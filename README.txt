This repository contains work done by Joakim Kaseva. The code is for LUT's Object oriented programming -course, spring of 2023.

IDE VSCode

If issues:

ClassNotFoundException: In terminal "cd .." and run code from terminal
Compile with javac *.java in main file, if issues.

so:

../src/main> javac *.java
../src/main> cd ..
../src> java main.App

Java_Valikko.py is a program by me that writes the base of the Java code required in LUT excercises. It is modified from another program I made dedicated to LUT's Python courses. Therefore this program creates code that has to be cleaned and filled by hand.
